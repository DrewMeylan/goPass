   >> Initialization must include authentication processes for joining a cluster.
>> Refactor code for reading and writing files
   >> Separate encryption/decryption functions to crypto pkg
   >> Should handle all logic surrounding creating directories, files, folders, etc (currently some of this logic is handled by the cobra commands)

Added RemoveSection and AddSection commands to file package; will be used for modifications to config file
